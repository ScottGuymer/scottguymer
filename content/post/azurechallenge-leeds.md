This week I attended the Azure Challenge in Leeds hosted by Microsoft at the Hilton Leeds City.

This was not your average workshop...

Starting off

Getting more complex

Load testing

The competition

Performance improvements

## Team8 FTW

In the end we won a copy of [Kubernetes: Up and Running](http://amzn.eu/hh5St3h) each! I would highly recommend this book as your first port of call should you want to get up to speed with kubernetes. Its simple, concise and covers all the bases. As a bonus its co-authored by the founders of kubernetes so you are getting the info straight from the horses mouth!
