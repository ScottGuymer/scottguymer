Hi! Im Scott.

I am a software engineer, father of 2 and husband. I work in Eindhoven for Philips Healthcare. My thoughts and opinions are all my own no one else's.

I blog about code, technology, gadgets, geeks and life in general. I am super passionate about what I do and strive to learn as much as I can each day and to try and pass that onto other people. I love to surround myself with smart, funny people and live life to the full.

I was born and brought up in Manchester, UK and attended Manchester University I have worked in a lot of diverse roles and have travelled the UK with work. I have worked for small companies and very large companies and a bit in between too. I moved to Eindhoven in the Netherlands in 2019.
