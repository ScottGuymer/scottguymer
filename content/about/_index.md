Hi! Im Scott.

I am a developer, dad and husband. I work in Leeds for Sky. My thoughts and opinions are all my own no one elses.

I blog about code, technology, gadgets, geeks and life in general. I am super passionate about what I do and strive to learn as much as I can each day and to try and pass that onto other people. I love to surround myself with smart, funny people and live life to the full.

I was born and brought up in Manchester, UK and attended Manchester University I have worked in a lot of diverse roles and have travelled the UK with work. I have worked for small companies and very large companies and a bit in between too. I moved over the pennines and love it here, cant think of going back. I got married in 2013 and have 2 kids and a daft dog called Maisie.
